# Dual-axis-Solar-tracking

Currently the solar systems available are mostly fixed at a particular angle facing towards the Sun. But , as we know that the Sun moves constantly during the day from East to West. Also, over a year, it also changed its postion from North to South. This might hinder the efficiency of the solar panels . Hence in order to obtain maximum results, we need to track the sun. We will be using 12 Ldr sensors module arranged in a particular manner.
